                        You might have played with a Radio Control (RC) toy before, such as a toy car. Imagine that, instead of looking at the vehicle from the outside, you could be virtually “sitting” inside the vehicle? That’s FPV.
                        Maybe you’ve played a video game where you fly an aircraft through a virtual environment. What if, instead of flying a virtual aircraft, you could be flying a real aircraft through a real environment? That’s FPV!

                        NOT MY WORK-->The word drone has taken on many meanings over the past few decades. 
                        But today, the word drone is globally used to describe the small non-manned flying machines that rely on multiple propellers to sustain flight.
                        A multi-rotor is an aircraft that flies not by air traveling over wings, but by propellers blowing air downwards. 
                        The most common multi-rotor type is a quadcopter, which has four rotors (spinny things). 
                        There are also bicopters (2 rotors), tricopters (3 rotors), hexacopters (6 rotors), octocopters (8 rotors), and so on.

                        NOT MY WORK--> What makes a drone so awesome is how versatile its range of movements is. By adjusting the thrust between the motors, 
                        the drone can tilt itself and move through the air in any direction. It can hover in place. It can move sideways. 
                        It can move up, and down, and forwards, and backwards.
                        Now this: we’re putting a camera on that drone! And the camera transmits the image to a display and then to your eyes, 
                        so you’re virtually sitting inside the drone!
                        So you get all that freedom of movement, the freedom of flight, opening the door to creative expression on an unprecedented level.  <br>
